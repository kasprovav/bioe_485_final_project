### Optimization of Numerical Methods for Tumor Detection in Noisy X-Ray Images

Leila Williams and Vira Kasprova

Abstract:
The project aims to address a significant challenge in biomedical image processing: the detection and visualization of tumors in X-ray images compromised by Gaussian noise. This inverse problem involves the restoration of image quality to facilitate accurate tumor detection, which is crucial for timely and effective medical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose to implement and systematically evaluate a suite of numerical optimization methods, namely Fourier, Gaussian, Wiener, and Median filters, to recover and enhance the image quality. The project will compare these methods in terms of their ability to improve tumor visualization while assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency.
